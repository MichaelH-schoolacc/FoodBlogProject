    <h2>About Me</h2>

  <br>
  <p>I started reviewing foods and getting into the greater world of food when I was 7.
  <br>
     This all started when I went to a pizzaria that surved I dare to say the best pizza ever. The thing about it is that it was fresh. Before that I really didn't eat fresh foods.
  <br>
     After tasting that I really wanted to try other foods that were made fresh just that that pizza.
  <br>
     After trying new foods for about a month I really wanted to tell others about the food I ate and also wanted to recommend new foods that I've tried to other people
  <br>
     And after that moment my carrier just took off</p>

  <p>If you can't tell already pizza is my favorite food and has been for a long time.
  <br>
     It has been a food that when me and my family were tight on money, we can go and pick one up for a dollar.
  <br>
     It's a food that will always be with me and if given a choice, I would almost always pick pizza over any other food.
  <br>
     It smells like something I can't describe and it's taste is a perfect mix of cheese, tomato sauce, and bread.
  <br>
     No other food comes close to the flavour of pizza. It's honestly a food that almost no one can really mess up.
